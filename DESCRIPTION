Title: The R to MOSEK Optimization Interface
Author: MOSEK ApS
Contact: MOSEK ApS <rmosek@mosek.com>
Description: This is a meta-package designed to support the
        installation of Rmosek (>= 6.0) and bring the optimization
        facilities of MOSEK (>= 6.0) to the R-language. The interface
        supports large-scale optimization of many kinds: Mixed-integer
        and continuous linear, second-order cone, exponential cone and
        power cone optimization, as well as continuous semidefinite
        optimization. Rmosek and the R-language are open-source
        projects. MOSEK is a proprietary product, but unrestricted
        trial and academic licenses are available.
